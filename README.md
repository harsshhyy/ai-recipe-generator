AI Recipe Generator

An AI-powered web application built with Python and Flask that generates recipes based on user input. Users can enter available ingredients, choose a cuisine (Indian, Italian, Chinese, etc.), and select a diet type (Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, High Protein). The backend uses Flask to process input and return generated recipe results.

Features:
User-friendly form to enter ingredients, cuisine, and diet type
Dynamic recipe generation (AI logic will be added in later phases)
Results displayed in a clean HTML template
Easy-to-extend backend for AI integration

Tech Stack :
Backend: Python + Flask
Frontend: HTML + Jinja2 Templates
Future: AI model integration for real recipe generation
